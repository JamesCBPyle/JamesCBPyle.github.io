Outside of work I enjoy a wide range of hobbies which I try to make time for. 

Even though I haven't been able to engage with these as much as I would like in recent years due to ME/CFS I still ensure they don't fall completely by the wayside.

From bouldering to badminton and kick-boxing I'll happily try out any kind of indoor sporting activity, though I'm not too keen on rope climbing due to the heights. 

I prefer to keep away from the outdoors-y stuff, though if a group of friends are planning something I'll be there.

Aside from these I enjoy many of the hobbies you probably guess I do. Gaming of the video, board and tabletop varieties as well as media in all of its different forms are my go to for day to day relaxation.

Catch me in any number of twitch or youtube streams while grinding in an MMO or strategy game early on and then join me in the mines of Hoxxes. 'Rock and Stone!' my friend.

The last few years I've not managed to read as much as I would have liked (no research papers do not count) but I'll get around to reading 'Children of Time' any day now.

A lot of my passions relate quite extensively to the broader area of my research - complex systems. From gaming in RimWorld, watching video essayist espouse the intricate details of world-building in fiction and a long time love of speculative biology and evolution, give me anything with lots of interacting pieces and some sort of narrative and I'll probably be golden.
