# Welcome
I am James Pyle, though I usually go by JP.

# About me
I completed my 4 year Masters in Computer Science (MCOMP) at the [https://www.sheffield.ac.uk]{University of Sheffield} in 2017 achieving a first-class degree and then began a PhD in the [https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/visual-computing]{Visual Computing} research group. I am currently (as of 26/04/2023) writing up my thesis with working title: 'Efficient Knowledge Discovery in Agent Based Simulation Experiments'.

My research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to various parts of the experimental process in order to increase overall experiment efficiency. Researchers from any field with any level of coding proficiency can follow the provided methodology and simulation experiment description tool to create a reproducible simulation experiment script. The generated script uses knowledge of available hardware resources, and interim results obtained during the experiment, to efficiently delegate these resources and reduce overall experiment times, increasing the possible search space of the experiment and thereby the likelihood of discovering high quality results.

This research project required me to develop a range of skills in various research fields as well as technical implementations.

# Skills

**Learning the basics of new ideas, tools, frameworks and workflows** - My research originated as an extension of the [https://github.com/FLAMEGPU]{FLAMEGPU} (now [https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU2]{FLAMEGPU2}) framework for agent based models. This required me to quickly learn and adapt to the custom templating and generation environment in order to extend them to include my own work.

**Communication between colleagues** - I regularly took part in design and update meetings for the technical development of FLAMEGPU as well as attending research conferences and talks hosted at the university by professionals from a wide range of fields. Additionally I am providing modelling consultation for a research project helmed by the [https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/verification]{Verification} and [https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/testing]{Testing} research groups.

**Communication with other audiences** - I regularly interact with close friends who are in the professionals in computer science related fields as well as researchers from other research groups and faculties. I also have some experience in presenting and explaining my research to the general public. 

**Training and tutoring** - I tutored for a number of undergraduate computer science modules ranging accross all years of study in group and individual settings, leading group activities and problem solving classes as well as marking and providing personalised individual feedback. Additionally I provided student support and marking for the masters level GPU programming module, as well as a newly instated 3rd year module on algorithm design and complexity.

**Logical and critical thinking skills** - As with any research project a number of issues required logical and critical analysis in order to solve or avoid. For example the creation of a description language and tool for simulation experiments that both provided readability for uses without coding proficiency while also providing sufficient detail in order to be used for generating an executable experiment script. 

**Self management** - After many years of PhD work and suffering from both depression and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) I have been able to determine my own limits in terms of energy management. This requires task breakdown, goal identification, and ability to plan daily, weekly, and long term time management with a specific focus on flexibility due to the inherent unpredictability of daily ability caused by these disabilities.
